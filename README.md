# Q&A
- Questions no one asked but i'll answer
## Is this menu detected?
- no infact the complete opposite
## Will this menu continue to be updated?
- Frequently I don't see why to not stop yet
- and i've only been working on this since 11/23/2025
## Do the lag mods work?
- Yes though if you use the 6th option to much it will stop working till you rejoin the whole game
- I recommend using 3rd option
## Will you ever make a crash/kick/ban gun?
- No infact that is kinda bannable
- And kick gun is possible but i'm not gonna add that
## What are mods you are working on or planning
- Well i'm thinking about a game mode changer but i'll make a new section named "Modded Lobby mods"
- with a bunch of s*** that is detectable in normal lobbies 
- also I will be making the Modded Lobby mods check if you are in a modded lobby
## Do you test your own mods?
- Yes before I update and send to anyone unless the person is a tester their self
